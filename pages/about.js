            I.	 INTRODUCTION
            Bharatiya Lok Vikash Evam Shodh Sansthan (BLVESS) is a non-Government, non-political, non-profit organization engaged in agriculture. It was founded by a group of like-minded individuals belonging to different sections of society in the year 1996. The head office of BLVESS is located in the Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh. It is based in Varanasi and Mirzapur.  The organization is operating for the past 10-15 years in and around Vindhyan/hilly regions in Mirzapur, Varanasi, Sonebhadra, and Bhabhua districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
            BLVESS was overtaken by Dr Abhay Shanker Tiwari in 2007. It has worked for farmers’ prosperity, along with Banaras Hindu University (BHU) since 2008. In 2009 a project was sanctioned by the Institute of Agriculture Sciences, BHU by the National Agriculture Innovation Project (NAIP). BLVESS was one of the associates involved in developing 2000 farmers of 16 village clusters of the Vindhyan region of the Mirzapur district. National Planning Commission identified Mirzapur as the most disadvantaged area, known for low fertile land, smallholding, and poor farmers. The majority of women and children in this district are anaemic and suffer from zinc and iron deficiency.
            In 2010, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) alongwith International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) collected data in wheat-producing areas. In 2012, the first trial of HarvestPlus i.e., HPVS & HPST was done at Mirzapur. In 2013 and 2014, Biofortified seeds were provided to 15-20 farmers. The effort showed a positive impact on the target farmers, as the farmer’s income increased from 1.5 to 2 times.
